## The Project

XEarthLayer was created to solve a fundamental problem in flight simulation: the trade-off between visual fidelity and storage requirements. Traditional ortho scenery requires downloading hundreds of gigabytes of satellite imagery before you can fly, and you end up storing data for places you may never visit.

XEarthLayer takes a different approach—streaming satellite imagery on-demand, exactly when and where you need it.
